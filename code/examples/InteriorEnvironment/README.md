# InteriorEnvironment

This example assumes that `examples/PlayEnvironment` is already running successfully on your machine. See our [Getting Started](../../docs/getting_started.md) document for more details. The example behaves similarly to `PlayEnvironment` except for one additional step. You are required to unzip `InteriorEnvironment_Content.zip` (obtained from the unreal-ai Google Drive folder) into the `examples/InteriorEnvironment/Content` folder. Note that building and cooking this project for the first time takes a long time.
