#### What platform am I on? What are my system specifications? Do I meet the minimum specifications for the Unreal Engine?

#### What commit of the `spear` repository am I on? Am I synced to a specific tag, or am I synced to the head of the `main` branch?

#### What `SpearSim` executable am I using? Did I build it myself or download it? If I downloaded it, is my code synced to the correct tag?

#### If I built my own executable, what were the command-line options I used to build it? Does my issue go away if I download a pre-compiled executable and sync my code to the correct tag?

#### What am I attempting to do, what do I expect to happen, and what actually happened?

#### Here is the complete console output from when when I created the `spear.Env` object in my application.
