### What platform am I on? What are my system specifications? Do I meet the minimum specifications for the Unreal Engine?

### What commit of the `spear` repository am I on? Am I synced to a specific tag, or am I synced to the head of the `main` branch?

### What `SpearSim` executable am I using? Did I build it myself or download it? If I downloaded it, does my issue go away when I sync my code to the tag corresponding to my `SpearSim` executable?

### What am I attempting to do, what do I expect to happen, and what actually happened?

### Post the full console output from running my application application here.
